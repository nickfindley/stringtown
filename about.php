            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>Before our place was here, this was just a spot between the cities of St. Louis and Carondelet. Stringtown Road marked the eastern boundary of the Carondelet common fields.</p>

            <p>Eventually St. Louis annexed the city of Carondelet and everything in between. A streetcar came down Virginia Avenue, as the old Stringtown Road is now known. People built homes and shops. A neighborhood came into being.</p>

            <p>The neighborhood is called Dutchtown now. Lots of folks just call it the South Side. It's not the same as it used to be, but it's still mostly hard-working people trying to get by.</p>

            <p>Maybe people don't know their neighbors like they used to. We'd like to change that.</p>

            <p>We are here to bring our neighbors together over some good food and drinks at a decent price. Come in after work, grab a barstool next to your neighbor, and have a beer and a burger. Get to know each other. We hope you have a good time.</p>
